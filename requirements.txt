Suppose you have 3 different APIs you can call with member_id as a parameter.
so example API calls would be:

https://api1.com?member_id=1
https://api2.com?member_id=1
https://api3.com?member_id=1

and you'll get responses from these apis with similar responses:
API1: {deductible: 1000, stop_loss: 10000, oop_max: 5000}
API2: {deductible: 1200, stop_loss: 13000, oop_max: 6000}
API3: {deductible: 1000, stop_loss: 10000, oop_max: 6000}

As you can see above the API's don't always agree. The task is to build an API that calls these APIs and coalesces the responses with a strategy.
An example strategy could be the average of the response fields. With the average strategy, your coalesce API would respond with:
{deductible: 1066, stop_loss: 11000, oop_max: 5666}

Your API should:
Take in the member_id as a parameter
Make the calls to the different APIs
Coalesce the data returned by the APIs
As a bonus challenge: allow for the coalescing strategy to be configurable
